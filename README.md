Rossman Store Sales Prediction Project
Rossman Store

Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the Rossman Store Sales Prediction project. The goal of this project was to predict the sales of various Rossmann stores across different parameters, enabling effective sales forecasting.

Key Features
Data Exploration and Analysis: In-depth exploration of the provided dataset, uncovering trends and insights that influenced sales.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing of the data, handling missing values, and transforming features for machine learning models.
Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features to enhance model performance and capture additional patterns in the data.
Modeling: Implementation of machine learning models, including but not limited to XGBoost and Random Forest, for accurate sales predictions.
Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation of models using appropriate metrics to ensure robust performance.
Project Structure
